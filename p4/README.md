## Improvements based on P3 peer review feedback
- I didn't fully understand the description of the tags problem but I fixed the problem where the PostsList routes were not always rendering the lists of posts for all tags.
- added comments explaining site title being an h1 heading on the home page and a div elsewhere
- removed unused CSS
